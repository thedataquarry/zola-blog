The idea is that the more people you know, the more opportunities you’ll have. However, for the majority of people, this is a chicken-and-egg problem: how do you get to work on interesting ideas/projects if you don’t know the people working on them? And how do you get to know people working on interesting projects if you don’t know what projects exist in the first place?<p>It’s well known that open source software (OSS) communities are a kind of large-scale social network. In this post, I want to cover how you, an individual, can leverage the vast OSS network to your advantage, while also actively contributing back to the network, and toward the open sharing of knowledge.<p>Because I’m a visual thinker, I’ll be using <strong>graphs</strong> to illustrate my points.<blockquote class="callout warning"><div class=icon><svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" height=20 width=20 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M12.865 3.00017L22.3912 19.5002C22.6674 19.9785 22.5035 20.5901 22.0252 20.8662C21.8732 20.954 21.7008 21.0002 21.5252 21.0002H2.47266C1.92037 21.0002 1.47266 20.5525 1.47266 20.0002C1.47266 19.8246 1.51886 19.6522 1.60663 19.5002L11.1329 3.00017C11.4091 2.52187 12.0206 2.358 12.4989 2.63414C12.651 2.72191 12.7772 2.84815 12.865 3.00017ZM4.20471 19.0002H19.7932L11.9989 5.50017L4.20471 19.0002ZM10.9989 16.0002H12.9989V18.0002H10.9989V16.0002ZM10.9989 9.00017H12.9989V14.0002H10.9989V9.00017Z" fill=currentColor></path></svg></div><div class=content><p>The term “graph” used in this post is from graph theory.

It’s definitely more than just a license to use software for free.<p>To me, the outstanding feature of open source is that it’s a form of <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/6782>publicly visible</a> collaboration between people who share a common interest in a particular area, whether it’s a programming language or a specific domain of knowledge. This work can take on many forms, from filing a simple issue on a public repository, to writing code that fixes a bug, to collaborating on a full-blown research paper with people distributed all over the globe.<p>Contrary to what your mind may tell you, you <strong>do not</strong> need to be an “expert” to be able to contribute. In a healthy open source ecosystem, <em>everybody</em> is on their own continuous learning journey – you’re just joining the train at a given point in time.<h3 id=i-open-source-is-an-intellectual-social-network>I. Open source is an intellectual social network<a aria-label="Anchor link for: i-open-source-is-an-intellectual-social-network" class=zola-anchor href=#i-open-source-is-an-intellectual-social-network>#</a></h3><p>Just like most of us keep some form of social media presence to remain in touch with our friends and family, open source platforms and forums are a means to find people who share your intellectual interests. The reward for inserting yourself into these networks, is the ability to communicate with people you may never meet in person, but who you can still learn from, with zero expectations of reciprocity.<p>Imagine communicating with a single individual on one of these forums (e.g., GitHub), whose own networks then expand your reach to a whole host of potential collaborators with similar interests. Note that it does take <em>action</em> on your part to insert yourself into this global network of smart people.<figure><img alt="The intellectual social network" loading=lazy src=oss-social-network.png><figcaption>The intellectual social network</figcaption></figure><p>It’s arguable that the network effects of OSS communities is, in large part, responsible for the explosion of innovation in the tech world over the past decade.<h3 id=ii-open-source-distribution-channels-are-governed-by-social-dynamics>II.

Open source software presents the same problem – why would someone use a tool, framework or language if there isn’t any content or community around it, OR, why would someone contribute to it if there isn’t yet a substantial number of users?<p>The reality is that the best tools aren’t discovered on the basis of their technical merits – <em>social dynamics</em> dictate a tool’s adoption, typically via open source forums, Discord and communities (like <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://news.ycombinator.com/>HackerNews</a>). Any company building on top of an OSS code base would be wise to invest heavily in building a community around their product, because that’s how they’ll get the most exposure to motivated individuals who advocate for their use (good luck to any proprietary tool vendors who are hoping for this).<figure><img alt="Open source as a distribution channel: all it takes is that one motivated user!" loading=lazy src=oss-distribution-channel.png><figcaption>Open source as a distribution channel: all it takes is that one motivated user!</figcaption></figure><h3 id=iii-open-source-thrives-on-positive-feedback-loops>III. Open source thrives on positive feedback loops<a aria-label="Anchor link for: iii-open-source-thrives-on-positive-feedback-loops" class=zola-anchor href=#iii-open-source-thrives-on-positive-feedback-loops>#</a></h3><p>Open source software can be broadly categorized into three buckets: <strong>tools</strong>, <strong>frameworks</strong> and <strong>languages</strong>. The beauty lies in how these categories are synergistic with one another via positive feedback loops that benefit the overall system. This is illustrated below at the individual and systemic levels.<h4 id=at-an-individual-level>At an individual level<a aria-label="Anchor link for: at-an-individual-level" class=zola-anchor href=#at-an-individual-level>#</a></h4><p>Say you, an enterprising individual, wrote a framework that solves a problem you had. You then publish it on GitHub, and it gets picked up by a few people who find it useful. However, the framework you built itself depends on other frameworks and tools, which connect you to a much larger ecosystem.<p>The more people who use your framework, the more people will use the tools it depends on, and the overall effect at each level propagates upstream (because people tend to give back to the systems they benefit from). This is the essence of a positive feedback loop.<figure><img alt="OSS communities and feedback loops (1)" loading=lazy src=oss-feedback-loops-2.png><figcaption>OSS communities and feedback loops (1)</figcaption></figure><h4 id=at-a-systemic-level>At a systemic level<a aria-label="Anchor link for: at-a-systemic-level" class=zola-anchor href=#at-a-systemic-level>#</a></h4><p>Feedback loops also operate at a systemic level, as illustrated below.<ul><li><em>Languages</em> are the bedrock of the OSS ecosystem.<li><em>Frameworks</em> are built on top of languages, and are the primary means by which large-scale user-bases interact with the underlying language.<li><em>Tools</em> are built on top of languages and frameworks, allowing people to interact with combinations of underlying frameworks.</ul><p>In the graph below, each node represents a <em>collection</em> of tools, frameworks and languages, and the networks of people that interact with them. The positive effects from the usage of a tool propagate backwards to the frameworks, and the same holds true for frameworks to languages. In the end, a thriving open source ecosystem is a self-reinforcing network of positive feedback loops.<figure><img alt="OSS communities and feedback loops (2)" loading=lazy src=oss-feedback-loops-1.png><figcaption>OSS communities and feedback loops (2)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=iv-open-source-yields-compounding-returns>IV. Open source yields compounding returns<a aria-label="Anchor link for: iv-open-source-yields-compounding-returns" class=zola-anchor href=#iv-open-source-yields-compounding-returns>#</a></h3><p>We’ve all seen/used apps like Uber, in which multiple parallel innovations from decades of prior research in networking, GPS and mobile computing, all came together at a point in time to create a new product that was greater than the sum of its parts. The same holds true for open source software and ecosystems.<p>Say you, a developer, spend time learning and contributing to multiple frameworks, written in your language of choice. Over time, you end up working with many people, utilizing and improving the same tools and frameworks, all with the broader vision toward solving real world problems. Because of the positive feedback loops described above, the compounding returns from your efforts are far greater than the sum of those from the individual components. This is what allows a project’s complexity to grow with time, while delivering more and more value.<figure><img alt="Compounding returns from open source" loading=lazy src=oss-compounding.png><figcaption>Compounding returns from open source</figcaption></figure><p>The <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index>Hugging Face Hub</a> in the machine learning world is a great example of such compounding in action, where the entire ecosystem has moved forward while making knowledge and tools more broadly available to a large user base.<h3 id=v-open-source-communities-ensure-knowledge-redistribution>V. Open source communities ensure knowledge redistribution<a aria-label="Anchor link for: v-open-source-communities-ensure-knowledge-redistribution" class=zola-anchor href=#v-open-source-communities-ensure-knowledge-redistribution>#</a></h3><p>Tying back to the previous point, the compounding returns enabled by open source communities are only possible because of knowledge redistribution. This is illustrated below.<p>A tool, framework or language doesn’t <em>start off</em> as popular. Once passionate communities advocating for their use appear, they inspire novice users to learn from existing, more established users. Unlike the ivory towers of academia where you need prior accomplishments to be taken seriously, the beauty of open source software lies in its utilitarian nature – developers of these systems are driven by pragmatism and the desire to solve real world problems, and, by and large, are more than happy to share their knowledge with anyone who’s willing to learn.<p>The end result of such an ecosystem is that knowledge isn’t hoarded by a select few, but is instead redistributed to the broader community, allowing greater scrutiny of the underlying components and the overall advancement of the field.<figure><img alt="Knowledge redistribution is common in open source communities" loading=lazy src=oss-knowledge-redistribution.png><figcaption>Knowledge redistribution is common in open source communities</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id=part-2-what-i-ve-gained-through-my-oss-contributions>Part 2: What I’ve gained through my OSS contributions<a aria-label="Anchor link for: part-2-what-i-ve-gained-through-my-oss-contributions" class=zola-anchor href=#part-2-what-i-ve-gained-through-my-oss-contributions>#</a></h2><p>I’m writing this section to reinforce the idea that you <strong>do not</strong> need prior expertise in a tool, framework or language to begin contributing to open source. Like many others, I’ve experienced my fair share of impostor syndrome, and my best experiences in the open source world came because I took actions, <em>inserted myself into the global network</em>, and let events take their natural course. I’ll highlight three specific examples below.<h3 id=i-a-fruitful-collaboration-that-might-have-never-happened>I.

We ended up working with a talented team that had funding for this kind of work and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://caiac.pubpub.org/pub/a7a2cy9j/release/1>published our findings</a> on French NLP. This simple initial action led me to a ton of experiences I’d never have had if I’d stayed silent.<blockquote><p>Key takeway: <strong>Don’t hesitate to reach out to people.</strong> The worst that can happen is that they don’t respond.

From a career development standpoint, working with proprietary software simply cannot yield the rich social and intellectual experiences that open source communities can provide.<p>To wrap up, I’ll list some key points to remember regarding the larger open source ecosystem.<ul><li><p>The majority of people out there don’t know you exist. OSS communities are a great way to become visible to people who are literally anywhere in the world, but gaining this visibility can take consistent effort and time.</p><li><p>The advancement of knowledge in the open source world relies on publicly visible contributions and collaboration, so do your best to put your work out there (whenever permissible). Use artificial data and anonymized results to showcase your projects, if required.</p><li><p>Do not expect rewards for contributions. The best way to approach open source is to think of it as a way to give back to the community that you benefit from. The rewards will come in the form of new opportunities and connections that you’d never have had otherwise.</p><li><p>Most importantly, OSS contributions can come in <em>many</em> forms, not just code. Documentation, issue filing, and even just sharing your experiences with others and spreading the word about tools you’ve enjoyed working with, as I have done in in various other posts in this blog, are all part of building a thriving community that advances the state of the art.</p></ul><p>As the title of this post states, it’s not just the network that can impact the individual; the reverse is equally true.
