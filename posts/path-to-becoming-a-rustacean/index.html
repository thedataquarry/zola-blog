This is great for getting something up and running quickly, but it also means that your initial runs in production will almost always error out, due to bugs that can only be discovered at run time depending on the existing environment. This leads to a frustrating developer experience, and worse, some of these bugs can be incredibly hard to track down in a large codebase.<p>In a recent Python project, I spent 3 days tracking down a bug (with unhelpful error messages) that I painstakingly discovered was related to an invalid datetime object.

When learning a new programming language, conventional wisdom states that you go “bottom-up”, starting with the fundamental concepts and building up from there – this is typically done via books and tutorials. Alternatively, a lot of folks choose to begin “top-down”, starting with a high-level overview of a problem of interest and then diving into the details that are relevant to that problem, by directly working with code and examples.<p>Personally, I’ve found that the best way to learn Rust is to approach it from <strong>both directions at the same time</strong>, i.e., alternate between the bottom-up and top-down approaches when you’re starting off. This is because Rust has a lot of concepts that are hard for beginners, like traits, references, borrowing and lifetimes, but these concepts are ubiquitous throughout the language, in a way that you can’t sequentially increase the complexity of your learning without getting stuck.<figure><img alt="Learning Rust by mixing top-down and bottom-up approaches" loading=lazy src=rust-learning-modes.png><figcaption>Learning Rust by mixing top-down and bottom-up approaches</figcaption></figure><p>Start by reading <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>The Rust Book</a> cover to cover and then go through some pre-built exercises (like <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings>Rustlings</a>). <strong>It’s okay if it all doesn’t make sense in the beginning</strong> – the primary goal should be to get a sense of the terminologies used in Rust, and to get a feel for the language’s syntax and structure.<p>The following subsections will go into more detail on the steps I followed that were very helpful to a) get motivated and b) remain motivated to continue learning even when the going got tough.<h3 id=1-consume-all-the-content>1. Consume all the content<a aria-label="Anchor link for: 1-consume-all-the-content" class=zola-anchor href=#1-consume-all-the-content>#</a></h3><p>I had a <em>lot</em> of fun this year reading blog posts, watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts and simply following other Rustaceans on Twitter, giving me a very clear drive and focus towards wanting to go deeper on my own terms. Just like with any other language, I believe the best way to learn Rust is to consume as much content on it as you can to gain a birds-eye view of useful features, and to then try and apply it to your own problems.<figure><img alt="Consuming Rust resources of a broad variety is the most effective way to learn" loading=lazy src=rust-learning-materials.png><figcaption>Consuming Rust resources of a broad variety is the most effective way to learn</figcaption></figure><p>Keep alternating between the various forms of learning material, allowing your brain to process the information in different forms. Over time, you get hooked, and the pieces start to come together in your mind.

The <strong>key</strong> is to convince yourself of what aspects of Rust resonate with <strong>you</strong>. Depending on your technical background and career interests, your answer could be vastly different from mine.<p>In my case, it was the exact reasons I listed <a href=https://thedataquarry.github.io/posts/path-to-becoming-a-rustacean/#why-i-need-more-than-python>above</a> and my frustrations with Python’s type system (or lack thereof), that led me to discover Rust. Having consumed my fair share of podcasts, YouTube videos, blogs and books over the course of a year, I’d learned a great deal about Rust’s expressive type system, strong emphasis on safety and what having good compiler checks can do in terms of catching bugs early on.<h3 id=3-embrace-the-memes>3.

Before you know it, you’ll find yourself evangelizing Rust to your friends and colleagues, not to mention you’ll be posting about your work publicly and potentially collaborating on bigger projects with like-minded people.<figure><img alt="Yes, I might soon become one of <a href='(https://x.com/shuttle_dev/status/1731780419870241177)'>these guys</a> 😄" loading=lazy src=rust-shuttle-tweet.png><figcaption>Yes, I might soon become one of <a href=(https://x.com/shuttle_dev/status/1731780419870241177)>these guys</a> 😄</figcaption></figure><h2 id=rust-isn-t-hard-it-s-just-different>Rust isn’t hard, it’s just <em>different</em><a aria-label="Anchor link for: rust-isn-t-hard-it-s-just-different" class=zola-anchor href=#rust-isn-t-hard-it-s-just-different>#</a></h2><p>No matter what language you’re coming from (or, even if this is your first exposure to a programming language), the best way to approach Rust is to think of it as a language that’s <em>different</em> from what you’re used to, rather than a language that’s hard in and of itself. Rust is a big and feature-rich language whose core concepts can take time and effort to grasp, but there are plenty of resources out there to learn it over a sustained period.<p>I’d argue that writing Rust <em>makes me a better Python programmer</em>, as I find myself thinking about my code’s structure much more carefully than I would if I were haphazardly prototyping in a dynamically typed language. In Rust, you pay a cost upfront to write safer and correct code, which in turn makes you think about your code’s structure and design from the get-go.<p>Although the initial “honeymoon” period will come to an end and you might hit a wall with concepts like ownership, borrowing, traits and lifetimes, these are all part of what makes Rust so powerful. The beauty of Rust is in the fact that the parts that are hard, <em><strong>need to be</strong></em>, because they deal with core aspects of computing right down to the machine level, whereas the parts that are easy (like managing dependencies and distributing your code) are truly a breeze because they’ve been so well designed from the ground up.<p>A key stage in your Rust journey is when you stop feeling frustrated with the compiler, but instead start viewing it as your ally. <strong>The compiler exists to help you write better code</strong>. You spend your valuable time working with logical issues rather than the mundane, allowing you to solve problems of greater complexity with the confidence that your code is safe and will run reliably in production.<p>Is Rust the perfect language? No, but no language really is. There will most definitely be periods early on in the journey where you don’t feel as productive as you did in your erstwhile favourite language, but here, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>The Rust Book</a> is forever your friend, and you’ll find yourself re-reading the book multiple times as you pick up on things you missed the first time around.<h2 id=conclusions>Conclusions<a aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusions" class=zola-anchor href=#conclusions>#</a></h2><p>For me, this is just the start of a multi-year journey learning Rust, and I’m excited to see what this ongoing wave of enthusiasm among new and established Rustaceans blossoms into over the coming years. After all, Rust is a language that’s been designed to be around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3AdN7U24iU" rel="nofollow noreferrer">for the next 40 years</a>. Having come to Rust from Python for the <em>safety</em> and <em>reliability</em> that it offers, the speed/efficiency gains it offers are just the icing on the cake.<p>It’s very easy for one to feel impostor syndrome while learning Rust. Tim McNamara frames this really well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDtQaO5_SOw&t=30s" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>start small, and grow gradually</em></a>. When you’re starting off, it’s <strong>OK</strong> to write basic code that might be inefficient, as long as it works and achieves the intended goal. Chances are, your relatively naive Rust code will still be way faster than your Python code. 😀<p>When do you call yourself a Rustacean? <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://nostarch.com/blog/software-engineer-jon-gjengset-gets-nitty-gritty-rust>Jon Gjengset’s take</a> is: “You are a Rustacean from just before the first time you ask yourself whether you might be one”.<p>Having spent some <em>serious</em> time studying Rust this past year, I’ve come to frame it for myself as follows:<blockquote><p><em>If you find yourself thinking about Rust, writing Rust code and spreading the word about it, you are a Rustacean.</em> 😎</blockquote><hr><h2 id=learning-materials>Learning materials<a aria-label="Anchor link for: learning-materials" class=zola-anchor href=#learning-materials>#</a></h2><p>This section summarizes some great learning resources I’ve come across and benefitted from in my learning path.
