world of database systems, the client/server architecture has been by far the most widespread. Databases whose names you’re likely very familiar with, like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB and many others, fall in this camp, whose foundations were laid in the early days of the web. Back then, the client/server architecture was a natural fit because it allowed for a separation of concerns between the client (the browser) and the server (the machine hosting the database).<p>Most databases that exist today are built using the client/server architecture, where the client is responsible for rendering the user/developer interface, and the server is responsible for storing and processing the data. It’s not a stretch to say that the world has progressed a <em>long</em> way since the early days of the web. As computing power has grown exponentially, modern embedded databases are able to do a lot more, <em>with a lot less</em>.<p>Although the idea of embedded databases is not new – SQLite has been around since 2000! – there have been numerous research breakthroughs in the last decade, making it possible for vendors to build fast, lightweight, and easy to use alternatives to established solutions like Postgres or MySQL, especially for the massive analytical and ML workloads we’re seeing today.<p>However, a lot of these enterprise solutions are designed for “big” data (whatever that means for your organization). But there’s a whole ocean of use cases <em>in between</em> single-CPU, in-memory analytics and large-scale, distributed analytics. It’s in this middle ground where embedded databases shine ✨, because they’re designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and are extremely performant for analytics, from small-scale (a few million) to large-scale (billion-size) datasets.<p>The aim of this series is to first gain a birds-eye view of the embedded database landscape, and how their interplay with Apache Arrow ecosystem is allowing for greater flexibility in data modelling than was possible before. From an OLAP perspective, three particular vendors are really exciting: <strong>DuckDB</strong> in the relational world, <strong>Kùzu</strong> for graphs, and <strong>LanceDB</strong> for vectors.<h2 id=some-background>Some background<a aria-label="Anchor link for: some-background" class=zola-anchor href=#some-background>#</a></h2><p>Real-world data processing workloads can be broadly broken into two: <strong>OLTP</strong> (online transactional processing and) <strong>OLAP</strong> (online analytical processing). OLTP workloads involve a lot of small, fast transactions, like updating a user’s profile, or adding a new item to a shopping cart. OLAP workloads, on the other hand, involve a lot of complex, long-running queries, like aggregating over a large dataset, or joining several large tables.<p>Over the years, the client/server architecture has been a great fit for OLTP workloads, but has been less than ideal for OLAP workloads, mainly because their underlying storage is row-oriented. This has led to a host of OLAP data warehouses being built specifically to process heavy analytical workloads, such as Snowflake, Clickhouse and BigQuery, which are designed to use columnar storage.<p>I’m focusing specifically on the 3 solutions shown below, because they’re all open-source, and importantly, <strong>they embrace unorthodoxy</strong> at their core – they do away with existing designs, and instead innovate by starting from a clean slate.<figure><img alt="The unifying interface for modern data: Arrow" loading=lazy src=embedded-db-breakdown.png><figcaption>The unifying interface for modern data: Arrow</figcaption></figure><p>The bottom part of the image is particularly interesting: <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://arrow.apache.org/>Arrow</a>, a language-agnostic development ecosystem for in-memory data, is the common denominator between all three of these databases, allowing data from one paradigm to relatively easily be transformed into another (despite the databases themselves implementing different data models). The Arrow format was designed from the ground up to be a columnar, fast and in-memory format for flat and hierarchical data, to be efficient for analytical operations on modern CPUs and GPUs.<h3 id=what-is-an-embedded-database>What is an embedded database?<a aria-label="Anchor link for: what-is-an-embedded-database" class=zola-anchor href=#what-is-an-embedded-database>#</a></h3><p>An embedded database is an <strong>in-process</strong> database management system that’s tightly integrated with the application layer. The term “in-process” is important because the database compute runs within the same underlying process as the application (which could be written in any language, like Python, R, JavaScript, C++). In the case of RocksDB, an open-source embedded key-value store written in C++, the application it runs inside<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#6>1</a></sup> could <em>itself be another database</em>!<p>A key characteristic of embedded databases is how close the storage layer is to the application layer. Additionally, data that’s larger than memory can be stored and queried on-disk, allowing them to scale to pretty huge amounts of data (TB) with relatively low query latencies and response times.<blockquote class="callout note"><div class=icon><svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" height=20 width=20 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M12 22C6.47715 22 2 17.5228 2 12C2 6.47715 6.47715 2 12 2C17.5228 2 22 6.47715 22 12C22 17.5228 17.5228 22 12 22ZM12 20C16.4183 20 20 16.4183 20 12C20 7.58172 16.4183 4 12 4C7.58172 4 4 7.58172 4 12C4 16.4183 7.58172 20 12 20ZM11 7H13V9H11V7ZM11 11H13V17H11V11Z" fill=currentColor></path></svg></div><div class=content><p>In the database community, embedded databases are sometimes referred to as <em>serverless</em> databases, but they do not mean the same thing.

However, it makes sense to first gain a birds-eye view of the breakdown of the landscape.<figure><img alt="Embedded databases organized by data model paradigm" loading=lazy src=embedded-db-landscape.png><figcaption>Embedded databases organized by data model paradigm</figcaption></figure><p>Key-value embedded stores are quite popular, due to their speed and lightweight nature, allowing them to power a host of other applications/databases downstream. However, the key-value data model is quite simplistic, allowing for limited expressivity in data modelling. The other three data model paradigms – relational, graph and vector – are much more powerful and expressive, and are thus the focus of this series.<hr><h2 id=duckdb>DuckDB<a aria-label="Anchor link for: duckdb" class=zola-anchor href=#duckdb>#</a></h2><p><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://duckdb.org/>DuckDB</a> is a high-performance embedded, ACID-compliant relational database system (RDBMS) that can be queried via a rich SQL dialect that’s very similar to Postgres. It’s written in C++, and is designed to be fast and easy to use. It’s designed to support large-scale OLAP query workloads, which are typically characterized by complex, relatively long-running queries that process significant portions of the stored data – for example, aggregations over entire tables, or joins between several large tables.<h3 id=an-interesting-take-on-the-big-data-narrative>An interesting take on the “big data” narrative<a aria-label="Anchor link for: an-interesting-take-on-the-big-data-narrative" class=zola-anchor href=#an-interesting-take-on-the-big-data-narrative>#</a></h3><p>In early 2023, the makers of DuckDB posted a blog with a click-baity title, “<em>Big data is dead</em>” <sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#1>2</a></sup>. It was very smartly (and aptly) countered in another article that came shortly after, “<em>Big data is dead … Long live big data!</em>”<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#2>3</a></sup>. Both articles are very well-written, and contain a lot of insights from folks who have spent years in the world of big data, so it’s recommended you give them both a read.<ul><li>The thesis: <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/>Big data is dead</a>, by Jordan Tigani, a founding engineer at Google BigQuery, now founder and CEO of MotherDuck, DuckDB’s commercial cloud offering.<li>The antithesis: <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://ponder.io/big-data-is-dead-long-live-big-data/>Big data is dead, long live big data!</a>, by Aditya Parameswaran, Associate Professor at UC Berkeley, and co-founder of Ponder, a data science startup.</ul><p>The first blog post makes the (rather strong) claim that the age of big data is over, and that because a large fraction of organizations don’t have Google-scale data, they are thus “overpaying” to enterprise data warehouse vendors for features or scale that they don’t need, and a lot of their workloads could instead be run on single nodes.<p>While this is largely true, the second post rightly counters this viewpoint (while also acknowledging that DuckDB is an excellent solution), by stating that although a large fraction of organizations don’t <em>yet</em> have big data, they will have big data <em>in the future</em>, because the relationship between having data and the ability to grow it (by better leveraging insights from existing data), is nonlinear. Organizations will <em>eventually</em> reach humongous scales of data, provided they have the right tools to organically arrive at that scale, and it all starts with having multiple tools that allow them to process data at all scales, from small to large.<p>I’m very much on board with both camps! Everything has to be taken in context, for each individual use case. 😎<h3 id=key-features-of-duckdb>Key features of DuckDB<a aria-label="Anchor link for: key-features-of-duckdb" class=zola-anchor href=#key-features-of-duckdb>#</a></h3><p>All jokes aside, DuckDB is a <em>seriously</em> powerful database, with a host of unique and amazing features that are straight from the world of academic database research. As they mention in their blog<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#3>4</a></sup>, DuckDB stands on the shoulders of giants.

Its origins and motivations are quite similar to DuckDB on two counts, in that it utilizes an embedded architecture, and that it came from an academic environment. Kùzu comes from years of research at University of Waterloo 🇨🇦, and applies several modern techniques for storage and query processing of graph-like data. It implements the Cypher query language, based on the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://opencypher.org/>openCypher</a> standard, allowing developers to unlock the full expressive power of graphs via a property graph data model (or <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://docs.kuzudb.com/rdf-graphs/>RDF</a>, if required).<p>A graph database, at its deepest core, despite its name, expresses a relational model. The main difference in the internals of a GDBMS and a typical relational system is that the GDBMS is optimized for storing and querying specialized data structures and join algorithms that are suited to modelling datasets with a high degree of connectivity, such social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and many others.<h3 id=key-features-of-kuzu>Key features of Kùzu<a aria-label="Anchor link for: key-features-of-kuzu" class=zola-anchor href=#key-features-of-kuzu>#</a></h3><p>Kùzu, being an embedded database, incorporates cutting-edge features straight out of the world of academic database research. A few of their key features for blazing fast graph query performance are listed below, as adapted from their excellent blog post, titled “<em>What every competent GDBMS should do”</em><sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#7>6</a></sup>.<ul><li><p><strong>Vectorized query processing</strong>: A graph database exploits the underlying relational structure of the data and stores it via an efficient columnar format in blocks, so that queries and aggregations can be processed in a vectorized fashion, fully exploiting the power of multiple threads on modern CPUs.</p><li><p><strong>Pre-defined, pointer-based joins</strong>: A graph database stores the neighbours of a <em>node</em> (a “record”, or a “row” in SQL terminology) as pre-defined relationships. While in a relational DB, a SQL query can make no prior assumptions about which tables are being joined with each other until query time, a graph database is all about exploiting the prior knowledge of existing relationships from the data, and instead uses a join index (i.e., and adjacency list index) to store these pre-defined relationships <em>at load time</em>.</p><li><p><strong>Many-to-many growing joins</strong>: A graph database is natively designed for many-to-many joins, on data that’s ever growing. If on average, each of the nodes connects with many other nodes and there are also many relationships in the pattern being searched, we’re basically asking the system to search through an exponentially growing number of combinations! Relational (OLTP) databases, because of their row-oriented design, cannot optimize for this use case.</p><li><p><strong>Recursive joins</strong>: Graph queries excel in performance for recursive join queries when compared with SQL, mainly because of the efficiency of the graph model in “hopping” over multiple levels of depth. Although SQL queries permit recursion, the idea of recursion was added as an afterthought in the relational data model, whereas in graphs, recursion is a first-class citizen.</p><li><p><strong>Schema querying</strong>: A special feature of graph querying that cannot be done in SQL is directly querying the <em>schema</em> of the database. A graph query in Cypher contains a subject, a predicate, and an object, and we are able to define the predicate directly on the schema, not just on the nodes/relations. This allows us to express a data modelling logic that would be a lot messier in SQL. To express the predicate (connective) logic between entities in relational tables, we would need to write a verbose query involving <code>UNION</code>s and other sub-queries, but this is just one line in Cypher (see the blog post<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#7>6</a></sup> for examples).</p><li><p><strong>Semi-structured data handling</strong>: In many cases, we may have data that contains deeply nested JSON, involving cases where one entity can have many types (a node representing Justin Trudeau can be both of type <code>Person</code>, and of type <code>Politician</code>, depending on the logic being expressed in the data model). A labelled property graph data model allows assigning multiple labels to these entities, providing added flexibility to the developer while designing the schema for the kinds of queries expected in the application.</p></ul><h3 id=goals-of-kuzu>Goals of Kùzu<a aria-label="Anchor link for: goals-of-kuzu" class=zola-anchor href=#goals-of-kuzu>#</a></h3><p>The goals and vision of Kùzu are very well articulated in their blog post<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#7>6</a></sup>, but the main summary is that it’s designed to be a fast, scalable and easy-to-use solution for graph data science, graph machine learning (via frameworks like PyTorch Geometric) and analytics on very large graphs (upwards of 100M nodes and 1B edges). It’s very well-integrated with the Python data science ecosystem, with client libraries in C++, Rust, Node.js, Java and of course, Python.<figure><img alt="Where Kùzu sits in the graph data science & ML Stack" loading=lazy src=embedded-db-kuzudb.png><figcaption>Where Kùzu sits in the graph data science & ML Stack</figcaption></figure><h2 id=lancedb>LanceDB<a aria-label="Anchor link for: lancedb" class=zola-anchor href=#lancedb>#</a></h2><p><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://lancedb.com>LanceDB</a> is an open-source embedded database for vector search built with persistent storage, which greatly simplifies retrieval, filtering and management of embeddings.

The client/server architecture has been around for a <em>very</em> long time, and has been proven to be a successful commercial model for numerous databases, which is why they are the norm in large-scale production use cases. The embedded architecture is still relatively new, at least for OLAP databases, and several vendors focusing on this section of the market are building them out as open-source technology, and are still figuring out their monetization strategies. However, the approach seems to be along the lines of the following:<ol><li>Build a sound open-source offering with the full functionality of their client/server counterparts<li>Showcase blazing fast performance 🔥 and ease of use<li>Gain a sizeable user community that advocates for its use<li>Offer a managed cloud service that builds on top of the open-source version, with added convenience features – from a pricing perspective, it would be essential that the cost is on par with (or lower than) tried-and-tested client/server databases</ol><p>One can only speculate, and <strong>time</strong> will tell how successful the various monetization strategies of embedded databases will be. My personal take is that there is already ample opportunity in both small and large organizations to use embedded databases for a wide variety of use cases, and the three vendors I’ve mentioned in this post, in my view, seem the best-positioned in their domains to be 💰 commercially successful in the long run.<h3 id=duckdb-motherduck>DuckDB + MotherDuck<a aria-label="Anchor link for: duckdb-motherduck" class=zola-anchor href=#duckdb-motherduck>#</a></h3><p>In early 2023, DuckDB made a significant announcement related to its monetization strategy, with its <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://motherduck.com/company/>MotherDuck</a> commercial entity spin-off entity.

As a developer who’s interested in one and all modelling paradigms, I can only speculate on the commercial angle of these solutions. In the upcoming posts in this series, I’ll go deeper into examples with code on each of these solutions.<p>Onward and upward! 🚀<p>Other posts in this series:<ul><li><a href=../embedded-db-2>Embedded databases (2): Kùzu, an extremely fast OLAP graph database</a><li><a href=../embedded-db-3>Embedded databases (3): LanceDB and the modular data stack</a></ul><hr><div class=footnote-definition id=6><sup class=footnote-definition-label>1</sup><p>Building on top of RocksDB, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-on-rocksd/>Cockroach Labs blog</a></div><div class=footnote-definition id=1><sup class=footnote-definition-label>2</sup><p><em>Big data is dead</em> by Jordan Tigani, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/>MotherDuck blog</a></div><div class=footnote-definition id=2><sup class=footnote-definition-label>3</sup><p><em>Big data is dead… Long live big data!</em> by Aditya Parameswaran, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://ponder.io/big-data-is-dead-long-live-big-data/>ponder.io</a></div><div class=footnote-definition id=3><sup class=footnote-definition-label>4</sup><p>Standing on the shoulders of giants, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://duckdb.org/why_duckdb.html#standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants>DuckDB docs</a></div><div class=footnote-definition id=5><sup class=footnote-definition-label>5</sup><p>Why we built Rill with DuckDB, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.rilldata.com/blog/why-we-built-rill-with-duckdb>Rill blog</a></div><div class=footnote-definition id=7><sup class=footnote-definition-label>6</sup><p>What every competent graph database management system should do, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://blog.kuzudb.com/post/what-every-gdbms-should-do-and-vision/>Kùzu blog</a></div><div class=footnote-definition id=9><sup class=footnote-definition-label>7</sup><p>Benchmarking random access in Lance, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://blog.lancedb.com/benchmarking-random-access-in-lance/>LanceDB blog</a></div><div class=footnote-definition id=8><sup class=footnote-definition-label>8</sup><p><em>S3 backed full-text search with Tantivy</em> by Rob Meng, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://blog.lancedb.com/s3-backed-full-text-search-with-tantivy-part-1-ac653017068b>LanceDB blog</a></div><div class=footnote-definition id=10><sup class=footnote-definition-label>9</sup><p>Building a time machine with Lance, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://blog.lancedb.com/building-a-time-machine-with-lance-3b14ab536232>LanceDB blog</a></div><div class=footnote-definition id=4><sup class=footnote-definition-label>10</sup><p>DuckDB vs. MotherDuck, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://kestra.io/blogs/2023-07-28-duckdb-vs-motherduck>Kestra blog</a></div></article><div class=giscus></div><script async crossorigin data-category=General data-category-id=DIC_kwDOKyWhTs4CbUSt data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-lang=en data-loading=lazy data-mapping=pathname data-reactions-enabled=1 data-repo=thedataquarry/thedataquarry.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDOKyWhTg data-strict=0 data-theme=preferred_color_scheme src=https://giscus.app/client.js></script></div><footer><div class=copyright><p>© 2024 Prashanth Rao</div><div class=credits>Powered by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=https://www.getzola.org target=_blank>zola</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=https://github.com/isunjn/serene target=_blank>serene</a></div></footer></main></div><script src=/js/lightense.min.js></script><script src=/js/main.js></script>
